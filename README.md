A repo for my probation report:

1. Teaching:  A Teaching Profile is required in support of your submission.  This should not exceed 3000 words and should be accompanied by limited (no more than 10 sides of A4 paper) supporting documentary evidence.  Guidelines concerning the structure of the Profile are available on the Human Resources website, (see following webpage and last item on the right hand side):

[http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/humrs/staffinfo/academicpromotions/index.html](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/humrs/staffinfo/academicpromotions/index.html)

However, if you have participated in the University’s Postgraduate Certificate in University Teaching and Learning (PCUTL), you may include your Module 3 (HMT007) Portfolio, either in full or in part, instead of a Teaching Profile.  If you do include your Module 3 Portfolio you will also need to provide a summary of your experience, including a list or table of the different types of teaching experience at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels, and the amount of time spent on teaching.

2. Research and Scholarship:  A list of publications should be given in date order, starting with the most recent, together with a list of research grant applications and their outcomes.  This should be supplemented by a statement of your projected research.

3. Contribution to Innovation and Engagement:  A brief note should be made of your contribution to the School’s/University’s innovation and engagement agenda and also your involvement in School/University administration.

4. Additional Requirements for staff employed at Grade 6 with a Teaching and Research role profile:  Following successful completion of your probation period you may be advanced to Grade 7, subject to the demonstration of the competencies associated with the Teaching and Research Grade 7 profile.  The appropriate role profile is attached to this e-mail.

When compiling your Final Probation Report please make reference to the ways in which you meet the competencies listed in the profile.  Please note however that you are not expected to meet all indicators in all areas.
