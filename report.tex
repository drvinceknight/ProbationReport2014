\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

This document aims to evidence my accomplishments during the probationary period of my lectureship:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Section \ref{sec:teaching} will discuss my participation in PCUTL.
    Due to the volume my module 3 submission, I will keep this section brief.
    \item Section \ref{sec:research} will not only list my publications and grant income but also discuss my future plans for research.
    \item Section \ref{sec:innovation} will demonstrate my contribution to innovation and engagement as well as a detailing my administrative responsibilities.
    \item Section \ref{sec:additional} will demonstrate my competency with the Teaching and Research grade 7 profile.
\end{itemize}

\section{Teaching}\label{sec:teaching}

\subsection{PCUTL}

I started PCUTL (HMT007) in [FIND DATE HERE] and completed the 3rd module on [FIND DATE HERE]. I fully engaged with this process obtaining my certificate with distinction.

My module 3 portfolio is attached but due to the page count of that submission (FIND PAGE COUNT) is summarised below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Rigorous statistical analysis of a student survey investigating student perceptions of formative assessment. A manuscript is in preparation to submit to a pedagogical journal.
    \item Detailed review and critique of active learning techniques including Inquiry Based Learning and Flipped Classrooms;
    \item Reflection within my subject area on the defining properties of a modern mathematician which should include not only entrepreneurial skills but also programming skills;
    \item Rigorous and justified implementation of a new module (MA1003) taught using an innovative and modern pedagogy (a flipped classroom delivered to a class of 160 students);
    \item Peer review by multiple Cardiff University colleagues, international peers and engagement with higher education academy.
\end{itemize}

The following summarises my present teaching philosophy which is a direct result of the PCUTL process:

\begin{quote}
   Aim to provide learning opportunities to students in a constructivist framework, using technology to enhance a scaffolded active student centred experience.

\subsection{Teaching}

As well as going through the PCUTL process I have been involved in various other teaching activities as summarised in Table \ref{tab:teaching}.

Most of the above courses are designed to be delivered in a student centred approach which is a direct implication of my growth as an educator through the PCUTL process.
