\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

This document aims to evidence my accomplishments during the probationary period of my lectureship:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Section \ref{sec:teaching} will discuss my participation in PCUTL.
    Due to the volume of my module 3 submission, I will keep this section brief.
    \item Section \ref{sec:research} will not only list my publications and grant income but also discuss my future plans for research.
    \item Section \ref{sec:innovation} will demonstrate my contribution to innovation and engagement as well as a detailing my administrative responsibilities.
    \item Section \ref{sec:additional} will demonstrate my competency with the Teaching and Research grade 7 profile.
\end{itemize}

\section{Teaching}\label{sec:teaching}

\subsection{PCUTL}

I started PCUTL (HMT007) in [FIND DATE HERE] and completed the 3rd module on [FIND DATE HERE]. I fully engaged with this process obtaining my certificate with distinction.

My module 3 portfolio is attached but due to the page count of that submission (FIND PAGE COUNT) is summarised below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Rigorous statistical analysis of a student survey investigating student perceptions of formative assessment. A manuscript is in preparation to submit to a pedagogical journal.
    \item Detailed review and critique of active learning techniques including Inquiry Based Learning and Flipped Classrooms;
    \item Reflection within my subject area on the defining properties of a modern mathematician which should include not only entrepreneurial skills but also programming skills;
    \item Rigorous and justified implementation of a new module (MA1003) taught using an innovative and modern pedagogy (a flipped classroom delivered to a class of 160 students);
    \item Peer review by multiple Cardiff University colleagues, international peers and engagement with higher education academy.
\end{itemize}

The following summarises my present teaching philosophy which is a direct result of the PCUTL process:

\begin{quote}
   Aim to provide learning opportunities to students in a constructivist framework, using technology to enhance a scaffolded active student centred experience.
\end{quote}

It might be of interest to note that recent research (appearing after I completed PCUTL) has in fact shown the evidence for better student learning in active learning pedagogies as opposed to a classic lecture based approach \cite{freeman_active_2014}.

\subsection{Teaching}

As well as going through the PCUTL process I have been involved in various other teaching activities as summarised in Table \ref{tab:teaching}.

\begin{table}[!htbp]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{p{5cm}llp{6cm}}
\toprule
Course Title & Credits & Level & Involvement\\
\midrule
Computing for Mathematics & 20 &  First Year BSc. & Designed, Lead and Delivered\\
OR 2 & 10 &  Final Year BSc.  & Designed and Delivered half of course\\
OR Methods & 12 & MSc. & Designed and Delivered 4/11 of course\\
Advanced Statistical Packages & 10 &  MSc. & Designed, Lead and Delivered\\
Introduction to Object Oriented Programming & NA &  MSc. & Designed, Lead and Delivered 2 day hackathon\\
Introduction to \LaTeX & NA & BSc. and MMath & Designed, Lead and Delivered half day course\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Summary of involvement in taught courses}\label{tab:teaching}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Most of the above courses are designed to be delivered in a student centred approach which is a direct implication of my growth as an educator through the PCUTL process.

This teaching has taken a large quantity of time in terms of preparation, the exact amount of time is difficult at this stage to approximate but the above corresponds to a mean of approximately 7 hours of contact time a week.

Future teaching plans involve the creation of an extra curricular 2 hour weekly session. During this students will be able to further explore aspect of programming applied to mathematics: Code Club.

\subsection{Research Students}

Throughout my tenure as a lecturer I have been heavily involved in the supervision of research students as various levels:

\begin{itemize}
    \item BSc. Final Year Students (10);
    \item MMath Final Year Student (1);
    \item Summer Research Students (7);
    \item PhD Students (5).
\end{itemize}

This aspect of teaching is something I am particular fond of and hope to continue.
In particular I hope to further enhance the involvement of undergraduates in research.

\subsection{Pedagogic Scholarship}

Further to the above I have fully engaged in pedagogic scholarship:

\begin{itemize}
    \item I have been the external examiner for the Statistics and Operational Research Program at the University of Greenwich since 2012. Due to my lack of experience this was done under the guidance of another external examiner.
    \item {I use my personal blog: \href{http://drvinceknight.blogspot.co.uk/}{`Un Peu de Math'} to write about research as well as mathematics education.
    The blog has more than 60,000 views and I estimate that 20,000 of those are on the subject of mathematics education.}
    \item I have spoken on the subject of mathematics education on multiple occasions including:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item PCUTL module 3 presentation (2013).
            \item Cardiff University special interest group on feedback (2013).
            \item Higher Education Academy STEM Education conference (2014).
        \end{itemize}
    \item I regularly run outreach activities in schools and am the chair of the OR Society task force: OR in Schools.
    \item In July 2014 Professor Harper and myself are hosting a workshop on innovative teaching approaches.
\end{itemize}

This engagement with the pedagogic community is a particular aspect of my job that I thoroughly enjoy and plan to continue to invest myself in.

\section{Research and Scholarship}\label{sec:research}

My research interests lie in the fields of Game Theory and Queueing Theory applied to Healthcare.
During my probationary period I have published 17 manuscripts in leading journals with one paper being returned to REF 2013.

\subsection{Publications}

A full list of my publications is given below. Of the 17 published papers 10 were published during my my probationary period.

\subsection{Future Plans}

I am proud of my research portfolio to date: gathering an international reputation in the fields of Game Theory, Queueing Theory and Healthcare modelling.
I have immediate plans for a number of papers that not only apply techniques to Healthcare modelling but also involve the theoretical understanding of behaviour in queues.

Some concrete examples include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item `On the solution of an equation that occurs in routing games';
    \item `Game Theoretic Analysis of CCU-EU interaction';
    \item `Equilibrium Behaviour in a series of two queues'.
\end{itemize}

Further to this, I am actively preparing my first grant proposal which will investigate the equilibrium behaviour and optimal control in queueing systems subject to time dependent variations.
This will not only involve a variety of mathematical techniques but also have a variety of applications in healthcare systems such as Emergency Units.

I also plan to investigate the potential for fellowships as well as continuing to grow an international network of collaborators (in 2013 I visited potential collaborators in Michigan).

\section{Contribution to Innovation and Engagement}\label{sec:innovation}

I am a very active contributor to the innovation and engagement agenda of the school of mathematics.

\subsection{Innovation and Engagement}

As discussed in Section \ref{sec:teaching} I regularly take part in outreach activities within local schools aiming to engage students and promote Cardiff University.
I have also regularly been an active participant in outreach activities taking place within the University.
This falls not only under my remit as a lecturer but also forms part of my responsibilities as Chair of the OR in Schools task force.

My outreach activities extend beyond the immediate physical proximity of the University as I have a very active web presence aiming to promote not only Operational Research and Mathematics but also Cardiff University:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Personal website \url{www.vincent-knight.com} with over 60 regular daily views.
    \item Google plus page with 26,000 followers and over 5,000,000 views of my content which include general discussions about Mathematics as well as the particular work done by the OR group within the School.
    \item YouTube channel (a combination of general outreach videos as well as teaching materials), over 114,000 views and 485 subscribers.
    \item A twitter account with 430 followers.
    \item My blog with over 60,000 pager views.
\end{itemize}

As well as Social media, I have also contributed to the University's exposure through traditional media outlets.
The ones that took place during my probationary period are listed below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 2012-12-27 - Pythagoras' Trousers Christmas Show
    \item 2013-02-14 - Pythagoras' trousers appearance to talk about prime numbers
    \item 2014-03-19 - BBC Parliament - Voice of the Future 2014
    \item 2014-05-05 - 2014 Pythagoras Lecture: Mathematics and Healthcare Management
\end{itemize}

My outreach activities were recently recognised through the fact that I was a judge for the SET for Britain 2014 poster contribution which took place at Westminster.
Two aspects of my probationary period can be considered of particular value to the innovation agenda of the school:

\begin{itemize}
    \item I am involved with two healthcare modelling units that are innovative in nature by the fact that they embed post docs within locals health boards.
          Currently 5 post doctoral researchers are in post sharing their time between a Health Board and the School of Mathematics.
          This innovative setup ensures that novel mathematical research has an immediate impact on healthcare services.
          Funding for these centres was listed in Section \ref{sec:research}.
    \item I am an active contributor to open source projects and further more am the administrator for the Sage server that is a valuable teaching and learning tool for our students.
          Furthermore, this server has allowed for substantial financial savings with regards to licencing of mathematical software.
          I also contribute to the open source community through my involvement in the Django Cardiff user group.
          The most recent international conference organised by this group involved 3 student participants whose places were financed by the School of Mathematics.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Administration}

As well as the various routine administrative duties (tutoring, meetings, etc...) I sit on the following administrative committees:

\begin{itemize}
    \item School Research committee;
    \item School IT committee;
    \item School Engagement committee;
    \item OR Society General council;
    \item OR Society Education and Research committee;
    \item OR Society Social Media committee.
\end{itemize}
