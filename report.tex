\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

This document aims to evidence my accomplishments during the probationary period of my lectureship:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Section \ref{sec:teaching} will discuss my participation in PCUTL.
    Due to the volume my module 3 submission, I will keep this section brief.
    \item Section \ref{sec:research} will not only list my publications and grant income but also discuss my future plans for research.
    \item Section \ref{sec:innovation} will demonstrate my contribution to innovation and engagement as well as a detailing my administrative responsibilities.
    \item Section \ref{sec:additional} will demonstrate my competency with the Teaching and Research grade 7 profile.
\end{itemize}

\section{Teaching}\label{sec:teaching}

\subsection{PCUTL}

I started PCUTL (HMT007) in [FIND DATE HERE] and completed the 3rd module on [FIND DATE HERE]. I fully engaged with this process obtaining my certificate with distinction.

My module 3 portfolio is attached but due to the page count of that submission (FIND PAGE COUNT) is summarised below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Rigorous statistical analysis of a student survey investigating student perceptions of formative assessment. A manuscript is in preparation to submit to a pedagogical journal.
    \item Detailed review and critique of active learning techniques including Inquiry Based Learning and Flipped Classrooms;
    \item Reflection within my subject area on the defining properties of a modern mathematician which should include not only entrepreneurial skills but also programming skills;
    \item Rigorous and justified implementation of a new module (MA1003) taught using an innovative and modern pedagogy (a flipped classroom delivered to a class of 160 students);
    \item Peer review by multiple Cardiff University colleagues, international peers and engagement with higher education academy.
\end{itemize}

The following summarises my present teaching philosophy which is a direct result of the PCUTL process:

\begin{quote}
   Aim to provide learning opportunities to students in a constructivist framework, using technology to enhance a scaffolded active student centred experience.
\end{quote}

It might be of interest to note that recent research (appearing after I completed PCUTL) has in fact shown the evidence for better student learning in active learning pedagogies as opposed to a classic lecture based approach \cite{freeman_active_2014}.

\subsection{Teaching}

As well as going through the PCUTL process I have been involved in various other teaching activities as summarised in Table \ref{tab:teaching}.

\begin{table}[!htbp]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{p{5cm}llp{6cm}}
\toprule
Course Title & Credits & Level & Involvement\\
\midrule
Computing for Mathematics & 20 &  First Year BSc. & Designed, Lead and Delivered\\
OR 2 & 10 &  Final Year BSc.  & Designed and Delivered half of course\\
OR Methods & 12 & MSc. & Designed and Delivered 4/11 of course\\
Advanced Statistical Packages & 10 &  MSc. & Designed, Lead and Delivered\\
Introduction to Object Oriented Programming & NA &  MSc. & Designed, Lead and Delivered 2 day hackathon\\
Introduction to \LaTeX & NA & BSc. and MMath & Designed, Lead and Delivered half day course\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Summary of involvement in taught courses}\label{tab:teaching}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Most of the above courses are designed to be delivered in a student centred approach which is a direct implication of my growth as an educator through the PCUTL process.

This teaching has taken a large quantity of time in terms of preparation, the exact amount of time is difficult at this stage to approximate but the above corresponds to a mean of approximately 7 hours of contact time a week.

Future teaching plans involve the creation of an extra curricular 2 hour weekly session. During this students will be able to further explore aspect of programming applied to mathematics: Code Club.

\subsection{Research Students}

Throughout my tenure as a lecturer I have been heavily involved in the supervision of research students as various levels:

\begin{itemize}
    \item BSc. Final Year Students ();
    \item MMath Final Year Student ();
    \item Summer Research Students ();
    \item PhD Students ().
\end{itemize}

This aspect of teaching is something I am particular fond of and hope to continue.
In particular I hope to further enhance the involvement of undergraduates in research.

\section{Research and Scholarship}\label{sec:research}

My research interests lie in the fields of Game Theory and Queueing Theory applied to Healthcare.
During my probationary period I have published X manuscripts in leading journals with one paper being returned to REF 2013.

\subsection{Publications}

A full list of my publications is given below. Of the X papers x of those were published during my lectureship.
